# Setting Up Bigquery

1. Followed the Google documentation to setup bigquery for my project_id:
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui

# Bigquery Data Import

1. Loaded movielens data from csv files on to bigquery. The following figure shows the imported tables movie, genre, ratings and movie-genre-relationship table. The CSV files were located on a google cloud storage.

2. Data Import from public data set - NYC City Taxi Data

Loaded data under my project for the  NYC City Taxi DATASET

# Upload from Datastore

uploaded movielens data from datastore to bigquery using the export utility

# Query Run Comparison

##First Example

1.Imported the NYC Taxi dataset in Bigquery and wrote the following query:

Find the number of trips starting from 01-Jan-2015 to 31-Jan-2015 with less than 5 passengers in the taxi:

`SELECT
  COUNT(*) trips
FROM
  compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_green_trips_2015
WHERE
  pickup_datetime BETWEEN ("2015-01-01 00:00:00")
  AND ("2015-01-31 23:59:59")
  AND passenger_count < 5`
  
 Query results for the above query are as follows:

Query complete (2.4 sec elapsed, 293.5 MB processed)

Row	trips

1	  1421052

Optimized the query by using partioning and cluster tables. 

Wrote the query below to create the table

`create table
compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_green_trips_2015_clustered
partition by
Date(pickup_datetime) 
CLUSTER by PASSENGER_COUNT as
select * from compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_green_trips_2015`

Ran the following query again against the new table to see the results:

`SELECT
  COUNT(*) trips
FROM
  compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_green_trips_2015_clustered
WHERE
  pickup_datetime BETWEEN ("2015-01-01 00:00:00")
  AND ("2015-01-31 23:59:59")
  AND passenger_count < 5`

Query results for the above query are as follows:

Query complete (0.3 sec elapsed, 23 MB processed)

Row	 trips	

1	   1421052

Got some impressive results above.
##Example2
Ran the following query to  get the number of trips per year made by fhv taxis

`SELECT MAX(EXTRACT(YEAR from pickup_datetime)) as TripYear, count(1) as TripCount FROM compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_fhv_trips_2015
UNION ALL
SELECT MAX(EXTRACT(YEAR from pickup_datetime)) as TripYear, count(1) as TripCount FROM compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_fhv_trips_2016
UnION ALL
SELECT MAX(EXTRACT(YEAR from pickup_datetime)) as TripYear, count(1) as TripCount FROM compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_fhv_trips_2017
order by TripYear`

Query results

Query complete (1.9 sec elapsed, 2.9 GB processed)

Row	TripYear	TripCount	

1	  2015 63867609

2	  2016 133285141

3	 2017 192092698


Used wild cared (*) in the above query to get the result

`SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from pickup_datetime) as TripYear, count(1) as TripCount FROM compact-cell-290609.NewYorkCityTaxi.tlc_fhv_trips_*
GROUP BY TripYear
ORDER BY TripYear`

Query results are as follows:

Query complete (1.5 sec elapsed, 2.9 GB processed)

Row	TripYear	TripCount	

1	  2015 63867609

2	  2016 133285141

3	 2017 192092698

Optimization was observed.
